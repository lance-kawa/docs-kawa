# Welcome ! üìÑ
I'm Ekawa, a code-wizard and Python whisperer, who's been casting programming spells for 5 years now. Currently, I'm riding solo as a freelance developer, navigating the digital cosmos. My magic lies in Backend development, and I speak the ancient tongue of Python fluently. Django and FastAPI are my trusty sidekicks, and Docker along with Linux environments are my playgrounds. You've just beamed onto the mothership of my documentation, so feel free to explore and have a blast!

# The Freelance Adventure ‚öî
*Etymology Time!* Did you know 'freelance' originally referred to medieval mercenaries, who would fight for whoever paid them the most gold? Pretty badass, right? Well, I‚Äôm like those knights of old, but instead of a sword, I wield code. And instead of a horse, I ride on endless cups of coffee. I battle bugs, conquer code, and quest for the perfect algorithm. Freelancing isn‚Äôt just a job; it‚Äôs an epic adventure!
